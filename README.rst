RoleMaster
----------

Organizational debt is quickly being recognized as an impediment to work being
awesome.  One tactic for eliminating organizational debt (#2 at

is to break down the work that needs to be done into accountabilities on roles
and then regularly iterating on the defined roles and accountabilities.

RoleMaster is designed to be the living documentation of an organization's
continuous participatory governance process.  Specifically, this tool is
designed to capture: 1) The roles that exist in an organization, 2) The
accountabilities and domains that belong to those roles and 3) Who in the
organization is filling each role.
